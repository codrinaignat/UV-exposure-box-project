# UV-exposure-box-project

Project structure:
- Proteus folder: contains the Proteus simulation of the schematic for the UV exposure box;
- UV_exposure_box_beta and UV_exposure_box folders contain the PCB and schematic of the project in KiCAD;
- uC program folder contains the MPLABX IDE files for the microcontroller, meaning the C code and additional files;
- Necesare.docx is a list of the necessary components in order to build an UV exposure box from scratch. The list is in Romanian;
- UV_exposure_box.pdf is the schematic of the project, in KiCAD.

The project's purpose is to make the PCB creation process easier. The UV exposure is necessary when you want to create a PCB using a photoresist copper board. 
The box has buttons to set the exposure time, to start and stop the exposure.
